## Background

An ex Meat Trader come Makers Academy graduate, disillusioned with the meat industry (and what it's doing to the planet).
I have worked my way up from a shop assistant, to an assistant foreman, to being second in command at a small business.
I dipped my toes into tech with a few short courses before deciding to take the leap into software development; combining my passion for problem solving with a desire to do something better.  

I'm looking for a role at which I can apply my existing skills and build upon them. Continuing to learn, working as part of a team delivering interesting projects and collaborating with likeminded people in a positive, supportive environment
